I'm a fourth year Ph.D. student in Statistics at the University of Michigan and I am originally from Montreal, Canada. I previously worked as a Data Science intern at the Ubisoft Montreal User Research Lab on online skill rating algorithms using approximate Bayesian inference. I did a masterâ€™s thesis at the University of Montreal on an adaptive Multiple-Try Metropolis algorithm aimed at sampling from complex distributions. 

My current research projects:

- Latent variable models using variational inference for node attribute imputation in network data (with [Prof. Ji Zhu](http://dept.stat.lsa.umich.edu/~jizhu/))
- Bayesian functional factor models for EEG-based brain-computer interfaces (with [Prof. Jian Kang](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~jiankang/) and [Prof. Ji Zhu](http://dept.stat.lsa.umich.edu/~jizhu/))
- Microbiome data analysis (with [Prof. Gen Li](https://sites.google.com/view/ligen) and [Prof. Ji Zhu](http://dept.stat.lsa.umich.edu/~jizhu/))
- Esophageal cancer risk prediction (with [Prof. Joel H. Rubenstein](https://www.uofmhealth.org/profile/649/joel-howard-rubenstein-md), [Prof. Akbar Waljee](https://michamp.med.umich.edu/akbar-waljee/), [Prof. Ji Zhu](http://dept.stat.lsa.umich.edu/~jizhu/) and others)
