I'm a third year Ph.D. student in Statistics at the University of Michigan and I am originally from Montreal, Canada. My current research, under the supervision of [Prof. Ji Zhu](http://dept.stat.lsa.umich.edu/~jizhu/), involves latent variable models and variational inference applied to network data. I previously worked as a Data Science intern at the Ubisoft Montreal User Research Lab on online skill rating algorithms using approximate Bayesian inference. I did a masterâ€™s thesis at the University of Montreal on an adaptive Multiple-Try Metropolis algorithm aimed at sampling from complex distributions.
