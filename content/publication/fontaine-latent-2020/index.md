abstract: 'We propose a latent variable model for paired comparisons in the context
  of Basketball scores. Based on the model proposed by [1], our model assumes multi-dimensional
  latent skills decomposed into offensive and defensive components as well as team-
  and conference-specific skills interacting with each other through an inner product
  model. We propose two inference approaches: maximum likelihood estimation (MLE)
  and mean-field variational inference (VI). Applied to the 2004- 2017 NCAA Men’s
  Basketball season’s, the MLE approach yields adequate and interpretable results,
  but the VI approach was not as successful. Based on the MLE inference, we study
  the relationship between teams and conferences, we investigate league-wide trends
  over time and we produce rankings of teams and conferences.'
