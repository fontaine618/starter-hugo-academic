abstract: The Kettles Esophageal and Cardia Adenocarcinoma predictioN (K-ECAN) Tool was developed and validated using a form of artificial intelligence of routine electronic medical records to predict which patients would develop particular types of cancer of the esophagus or stomach years in advance.

**Background and Context**: Tools that can automatically predict incident esophageal
adenocarcinoma (EAC) and gastric cardia adenocarcinoma (GCA) using electronic health
records (EHR) to guide screening decisions are needed.

**New Findings**: In this retrospective case-control analysis using machine learning, the Kettles
Esophageal and Cardia Adenocarcinoma predictioN (K-ECAN) Tool was well calibrated and
more accurate than available alternatives. While GERD was associated with EAC/GCA, other
factors added more information to the model.

**Limitations**: K-ECAN was developed and validated within the Veterans Health Administration
(VHA) population. Non-Veterans may differ in terms of the frequency of medical encounters and
laboratory blood draws, and non-VHA settings may differ in their practice of diagnostic coding.

**Clinical Research Relevance**: The Kettles Esophageal and Cardia Adenocarcinoma predictioN
Tool is an automated, valid tool predicting incident esophageal
