abstract: We propose an alternating direction of multipliers method (ADMM) based on
  the consensus scheme for solving regularized multi-task problems where the loss
  function is separable across tasks. We discuss the convergence of the algorithm
  and survey its statistical properties in the sparse group Lasso case. Through numerical
  experiments, we find that our proposed method can be particularly efficient in the
  number of proximal evaluations required to achieve convergence when compared to
  a more general method such as FISTA.
