	abstract = {Markov  chain  Monte  Carlo  (MCMC)  methods,  specifically  samplers  based  on  random  walks,often have difficulty handling target distributions with complex geometry such as multi-modality.We propose an adaptive multiple-try Metropolis algorithm designed to tackle such problems bycombining the flexibility of multiple-proposal samplers with the user-friendliness and optimalityof  adaptive  algorithms.  We  prove  the  ergodicity  of  the  resulting  Markov  chain  with  respectto  the  target  distribution  using  common  techniques  in  the  adaptive  MCMC  literature.  In  aBayesian model for loss of heterozygosity in cancer cells, we find that our method outperformstraditional adaptive samplers, non-adaptive multiple-try Metropolis samplers, and various moresophisticated competing methods.},

	abstract = {Actuarial practitioners now have access to multiple sources of insurance data corresponding to various situations: multiple business lines, umbrella coverage, multiple hazards, and so on. Despite the wide use and simple nature of single-target approaches, modeling these types of data may benefit from an approach performing variable selection jointly across the sources. We propose a unified algorithm to perform sparse learning of such fused insurance data under the Tweedie (compound Poisson) model. By integrating ideas from multitask sparse learning and sparse Tweedie modeling, our algorithm produces flexible regularization that balances predictor sparsity and between-sources sparsity. When applied to simulated and real data, our approach clearly outperforms single-target modeling in both prediction and selection accuracy, notably when the sources do not have exactly the same set of predictors. An efficient implementation of the proposed algorithm is provided in our R package MStweedie, which is available at https://github.com/fontaine618/MStweedie. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.},
