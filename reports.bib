	abstract = {The MovieLens datasets contain user ratings of movies as well as movie and user
information. In this report, we consider four predictive models of the ratings based on the
available information: K-nearest-neighbors, neural networks, matrix completion using singular
value decomposition and restricted Bolztmann machine. We tune all models to finally compare
them on their out-of-sample performance: matrix completion produces the best testing metrics.
Then, we propose two exploratory analysis methods in order to extract insight from the selected
predictive model.},

	abstract = {We propose an alternating direction of multipliers method (ADMM) based on the
consensus scheme for solving regularized multi-task problems where the loss function is separable
across tasks. We discuss the convergence of the algorithm and survey its statistical properties
in the sparse group Lasso case. Through numerical experiments, we find that our proposed
method can be particularly efficient in the number of proximal evaluations required to achieve
convergence when compared to a more general method such as FISTA.},

	abstract = {We propose a latent variable model for paired
comparisons in the context of Basketball scores. Based on the
model proposed by [1], our model assumes multi-dimensional
latent skills decomposed into offensive and defensive components
as well as team- and conference-specific skills interacting with
each other through an inner product model. We propose two
inference approaches: maximum likelihood estimation (MLE)
and mean-field variational inference (VI). Applied to the 2004-
2017 NCAA Men’s Basketball season’s, the MLE approach
yields adequate and interpretable results, but the VI approach
was not as successful. Based on the MLE inference, we study
the relationship between teams and conferences, we investigate
league-wide trends over time and we produce rankings of teams
and conferences.},

@techreport{fontaine_caught_2020,
	title = {Caught {Looking}: {Analyzing} {Variation} in {Umpire} {Strike} {Zones}},
	abstract = {As technology advances, Major League Baseball (MLB) has faced increased pressure from fans,
coaches, and players to use video technologies to aid umpires in making calls on the field, especially for
the notoriously subjective ball and strike calls. With this project, we will assess the ability of umpires to
make ball and strike calls that match the rulebook and that are consistent across different game situations.
Using nonlinear classification methods such as kernel linear regression and support vector machines we can
learn a strike zone for each umpire based on pitch location as well as game circumstances. After learning
strike zone classifiers for each game situation and umpire combination, we use kernel PCA to create a low
dimensional encoding of the strike zones that can be used for inference. We perform multiple analysis of
variance and mixed effects multivariate regression on the principal components to determine which factors
have a statistically significant effect on an umpire’s strike zone. Finally we compute a ranking of each umpire
and compare our top umpires with those featured on other lists.},
